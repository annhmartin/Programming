# Programming

## Things we need to do/figure out
Where do we want to run the code?  Maybe each on our local machines?
How do we hook GitHub to the area?  Where do we get instructions for this?

Once above is done, what are the parts of the code that we need to have for the game?
What imports do we need?
Is there a nice way to show the game board?

## Game
Design a game board with list or array (six-row, seven-column)
Create players
Have alternating turns
Placing pieces
Handling of invalid moves
Showing updated game board
Checking for wins/draw
Looping to change turns if game not won

## Optional
Have computer play against a single player
Create options for variations of the game and rules
When game is won, how to reset the game board
How to start another game with the same players
Tracking the score if there is multiple games (3 for win, 1 for draw, 0 for loss)
Saving of game(s) so that the players can come back

## Issues we have faced and how we solved them
### Lets add as much here so that our presentation we have a lot of things to talk about
- Not really understanding where to even begin on hooking everything up
- Not really understanding what python code is available to use and what it does
- Knowing how to divide up the work, do we split by coding different sections and we each do one portion
