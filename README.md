# Programming

## Things we need to do/figure out:

Where do we want to run the code?  Maybe each on our local machines?
How do we hook GitHub to the area?  Where do we get instructions for this?

Once above is done, what are the parts of the code that we need to have for the game?
What imports do we need?
Is there a nice way to show the game board?

## Game:
Design a game board with list or array (six-row, seven-column)
Create players
Have alternating turns
Placing pieces
Handling of invalid moves
Showing updated game board
Checking for wins/draw
Looping to change turns if game not won

## Optional:
Have computer play against a single player
Create options for variations of the game and rules
When game is won, how to reset the game board
How to start another game with the same players
Tracking the score if there is multiple games (3 for win, 1 for draw, 0 for loss)
Saving of game(s) so that the players can come back
